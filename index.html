       <h1>The Last Hope</h1>


        <p>
            Can you seem him there? Young. Smart. Charismatic. Conventionally attractive? That's him. That's the guy standing next to our hero. After 30 years of not being able to apply himself to any of his studies or fields, now is the time for a change.
        </p>
        <p>With renewed vigor, tenacity and a strong motivation to find a career path with actual prospects and the capacity for a career, he begins his journey anew, with Becod. Knights of the coded table, brothers in the war on poorly scripte websites, these heroes are all that stands between you and no being able to realise your next project.</p>
        <p>Anxious to see what happens next? You're not alone. Join us, as we watch our hero learn new skills, apply them to problems and find a new way to tackle them. But is he up to the greatest challenge of all... Mingling with new people?! Join us next week. Same Jack-time, same Jack-channel!</p>
